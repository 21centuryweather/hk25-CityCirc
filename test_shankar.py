üåç Reanalysis Datasets (observationally constrained)
ERA5: ECMWF's fifth-generation reanalysis. Provides global hourly estimates of many atmospheric, land, and oceanic variables.
IR_IMERG: Infrared-calibrated IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM). Satellite-based rainfall estimation product.
JRA3Q: A high-resolution reanalysis dataset from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JRA-3Q).
MERRA2: NASA‚Äôs Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2.
